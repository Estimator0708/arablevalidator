# Setup

Below you find the required steps to set up and start the validator script on an Ubuntu server.

## Installation 
Install Node and dev dependencies:

```
sudo apt update
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt -y install nodejs
sudo apt -y install gcc g++ make git
```

Install the [PM2 npm package](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a daemon process manager:

```
npm install -g pm2
```

Clone the validator project and install required npm dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:ArableProtocol/arablevalidator.git
cd ./arablevalidator
npm install
```

## Configure the environment variables
Navigate to the `arablevalidator` directory and duplicate the example configuration file:
```
cp env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in your favorite editor and set your private key as the value for `PRIVATE_KEY.` Make sure the account contains enough AVAX to cover any transaction fees generated when running the validator. The private key is never transmitted outside of the server.
```
nano .env
```

## Running the validator
To run the validator in the background, daemonize the `tokenvesting` script:
```
pm2 start npm -- run tokenvesting --
```
Verify that the script is running successfully in the background:
```
pm2 list
pm2 logs 0
```

To update to the most recent version of the script and restart the daemon:
  ```
  git pull
  pm2 restart 0
  ```

To stop the daemonized validator script:
```
pm2 stop 0
```

# Notes:

- The validator script performs transactions on the Avalanche network. Make sure to keep an AVAX balance in your account to cover transaction costs.
- For security reasons, keep only a small balance of AVAX in the account.
- As a validator, you are responsible for keeping your server secure.
